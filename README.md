## Installation

Please add your installation instructions here.

## Development

### Prerequisites

In order to build this module, recent versions of `node` and `npm` are
required. Most likely, using `yarn` also works, but only `npm` is officially
supported. We recommend using the latest lts version of `node`. If you use `nvm`
to manage your `node` versions, you can simply run

```
nvm install
```

in the project's root directory.

You also need to install the project's dependencies. To do so, run

```
npm install
```

### Building

You can build the project by running

```
npm run build
```

Alternatively, you can run

```
npm run build:watch
```

to watch for changes and automatically build as necessary.

### Linking the built project to Foundry VTT

In order to provide a fluent development experience, it is recommended to link
the built module to your local Foundry VTT installation's data folder. In
order to do so, first add a file called `foundryconfig.json` to the project root
with the following content:

```
{
  "dataPath": "/absolute/path/to/your/FoundryVTT"
}
```

(if you are using Windows, make sure to use `\` as a path separator instead of
`/`)

Then run

```
npm run link-project
```

On Windows, creating symlinks requires administrator privileges, so unfortunately
you need to run the above command in an administrator terminal for it to work.

### Creating a release

In order to create a versioned release, simply create / push a new tag that follows the pattern
`v<number>.<number>.<number>`. This triggers a pipeline run that automatically builds the package and creates a release
that has a `module.zip` / `system.zip` and a `module.json` / `system.json` attached to it. These files are set up so
that they work in the same way as in the [League Basic JS Module Template], so you can follow the instructions given
there to list the release on the Foundry VTT package admin page.

If you want to provide release notes, you can then edit the created release to add a description.
